## Reflection

Flexbox seems like a useful for CSS layouts and has become my go to due it's versatility. Centering with flexbox works much better than most alternatives and scales well at different screen sizes. I was surpised at how 'display:flex' makes it quite easy to create a beautiful layouts.
